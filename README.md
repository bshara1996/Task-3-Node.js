## 📋 Task Requirements
Write a program that defines an array of integers and calculates the quantity of zeros using a conditional expression (without using `if`).

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
node Task3.js
```

## 💡 Solution Approach

The solution uses:
- `forEach` loop to iterate through the array
- Logical AND operator (`&&`) or Ternary operator (`? :`) as a conditional expression to increment the counter
- Avoids standard `if` statements as requested
